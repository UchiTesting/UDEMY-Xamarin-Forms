===============================================

## 2020-06-30 #1

* Did exercice 1 about cyclic quotes app.  
The application consists into a button to cycle through a defined list of quotes.  
There is also a slider that is meant to set the font size.
The application is functional. The only missing point is the formatting of the value on the font-size label.
* Learnt you must put the Minimum property for a slider after the Maximum property due to a bug.
* Added the codes for the course code Lucky Number.
* Reorganised the solution file.
* Added README.md and current CHANGELOG.md files.
* Learnt line breaks in markdown are made with two spaces at the end of line.
